# 🤖 AInsights: Autonomous Agentic BI System

**AInsights** is a privacy-first, local-intelligence platform designed to transform raw, unstructured data into actionable business strategy. Powered by **Llama 3.2 (1B)** and running entirely without external API dependencies, it orchestrates a **Triple-Agent Relay** to clean, visualize, and reason through complex datasets.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Agentic Trinity

AInsights is built on a modular **"Separation of Concerns"** architecture where three specialized agents collaborate to provide a complete BI solution:

### 1. Agent A: The Universal Data Engineer

- **Role:** Ingestion, Sanitization, and Standardization.
- **Capabilities:** Native support for `CSV`, `XLSX`, `JSON`, `PDF`, and `HTML`.
- **Core Logic:** Employs a **"Pure Cleaning"** philosophy—performing deduplication, currency normalization, and date standardizing while strictly preserving original column names to ensure data lineage and integrity.

### 2. Agent B: The Adaptive Visualizer

- **Role:** Automated UI Generation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- **Capabilities:** Automatically classifies columns into **Metrics** (Numeric) and **Dimensions** (Categorical/Time).
- **Core Logic:** Dynamically builds interactive Time-Series Trends, Heatmaps, and KPI Cards based on data-type heuristics without requiring hardcoded column mappings.

### 3. Agent C: The Reasoning Analyst (The "Ultimatum")

- **Role:** Strategic Insight and Question Answering.
- **Capabilities:** Advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using FAISS vector storage.
- **Core Logic:** Operates a **Triple-Context Reasoning Loop**, synthesizing live dashboard statistics, document-based knowledge from PDF reports, and multi-turn conversational history to explain the "Why" behind business performance.

---

## ⚡ Scaling & Performance

- **Local-First Architecture:** 100% data privacy and zero API costs.
- **Persistent RAG Engine:** Uses HuggingFace (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) embeddings to index thousands of data rows and document pages into a local FAISS vector store.
- **Optimized Ingestion:** Features recursive character splitting for faster indexing of large-scale CSVs and complex PDF reports.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- **Ollama:** [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and pull the model:
  ```bash
  ollama run llama3.2:1b
  ```

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/itsjustRohitch/AInsights.git](https://github.com/itsjustRohitch/AInsights.git)
   cd AInsights
   ```

2. **Install Requirements:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the System:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- **Multi-Modal Ingestion:** Support for image-based receipts and charts.
- **Distributed Vector Storage:** Moving from FAISS to **Qdrant** for enterprise-scale indexing.
- **Agent Autonomy:** Allowing Agent A to automatically suggest new metrics based on detected data anomalies.
